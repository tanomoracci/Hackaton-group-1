# "Magic Mirror" HACKATON GROUP 1

## Setup
Clone: `git clone https://github.com/tanomoracci/Hackaton-group-1

Install: `cd Hackaton-group-1 && yarn`

Run: `yarn start`

## About the Poject
We manage to add a button to set the mic and the camera on/off. And we also added a button to get the link of the meeting room to be shared. 

## Video Stream Component
The Video Component is working but we couldn't do much more with that.


## File structure
Most of the file strucutre is there to support the video component. You should only need to focus on:
- `src/pages`: To create your pages;
- `src/components`: To create any components you need. You can ignore all the other ones that are there already;
- `src/App.js`: If you need to update the Routing.

Besides these files and folders, you can/should ignore everything else.
